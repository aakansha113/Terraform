 Terraform Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Projects

This repository contains Terraform configurations and practical implementations for managing cloud infrastructure as code. Terraform is an open-source tool developed by HashiCorp that enables you to provision, manage, and version infrastructure safely and efficiently.

1-What is Terraform?

Terraform allows you to define your infrastructure using a declarative configuration language called **HCL (HashiCorp Configuration Language)**. With it, you can manage:
- Compute resources (e.g., EC2, AWS VM)
- Networking (VPCs, subnets, routing)
- Databases, IAM, S3, and more
- Multi-cloud and hybrid environments

2-Learning Goals
-Understand core concepts: providers, resources, variables, state management
-Write reusable and modular Terraform code using modules
